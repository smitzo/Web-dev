Scenario: Smit (you) cooking noodles, and Babu helping asynchronously
Smit's tasks (synchronous): Cooking noodles, cutting vegetables, boiling water.
Babu's tasks (asynchronous): Bringing ketchup or other items that you request while you're busy with other cooking tasks.

1. Call Stack (Synchronous Tasks)
The call stack is like your personal cooking to-do list. It holds all the tasks you (Smit) need to complete sequentially (in order). When a task is done, it’s removed from the stack, and the next one starts.
For example, when you're cutting vegetables, you must finish it before moving on to boiling water. These tasks are synchronous, meaning you cannot start the next one until the previous one is done.
In the code context, synchronous tasks are like:
console.log("inside smitReadFile");
console.log(a);
These get executed immediately, and the next task starts only after the current one finishes.

2. Web APIs (Babu's Help with Asynchronous Tasks)
Sometimes, you (Smit) need Babu's help for things like bringing ketchup, but Babu works asynchronously. You ask Babu to fetch the ketchup, then continue cutting vegetables or boiling water while waiting for Babu to come back.

In JavaScript, Babu's tasks are handled by web APIs (such as fs.readFile in your code). These are non-blocking, meaning you don’t need to stop your cooking while waiting for Babu to finish his task. Once Babu brings the ketchup, you can use it immediately without stopping your current work.
In the code, the asynchronous task is:
fs.readFile(filepath, "utf-8", function (err, data) {
    // This task happens in the background (like Babu fetching ketchup)
});
Here, fs.readFile is handled by Node.js as a web API. While it’s fetching the file, other code can continue executing.

Memory updated
Let's break down the concepts of callback queue, call stack, event loop, and web APIs using your noodles cooking scenario and the code example you provided.

Scenario: Smit (you) cooking noodles, and Babu helping asynchronously
Smit's tasks (synchronous): Cooking noodles, cutting vegetables, boiling water.
Babu's tasks (asynchronous): Bringing ketchup or other items that you request while you're busy with other cooking tasks.
1. Call Stack (Synchronous Tasks)
The call stack is like your personal cooking to-do list. It holds all the tasks you (Smit) need to complete sequentially (in order). When a task is done, it’s removed from the stack, and the next one starts.

For example, when you're cutting vegetables, you must finish it before moving on to boiling water. These tasks are synchronous, meaning you cannot start the next one until the previous one is done.

In the code context, synchronous tasks are like:

js
Copy code
console.log("inside smitReadFile");
console.log(a);
These get executed immediately, and the next task starts only after the current one finishes.

2. Web APIs (Babu's Help with Asynchronous Tasks)
Sometimes, you (Smit) need Babu's help for things like bringing ketchup, but Babu works asynchronously. You ask Babu to fetch the ketchup, then continue cutting vegetables or boiling water while waiting for Babu to come back.

In JavaScript, Babu's tasks are handled by web APIs (such as fs.readFile in your code). These are non-blocking, meaning you don’t need to stop your cooking while waiting for Babu to finish his task. Once Babu brings the ketchup, you can use it immediately without stopping your current work.

In the code, the asynchronous task is:

js
Copy code
fs.readFile(filepath, "utf-8", function (err, data) {
    // This task happens in the background (like Babu fetching ketchup)
});
Here, fs.readFile is handled by Node.js as a web API. While it’s fetching the file, other code can continue executing.

3. Callback Queue (Where Babu Waits)
Once Babu finishes bringing the ketchup, he can’t just barge into the kitchen while you’re cutting vegetables. Instead, he waits in the callback queue until you finish your current task.
In the code, when fs.readFile finishes reading the file, it waits for the main thread to be free before executing the callback function (either resolving or rejecting the promise). This is where callbacks are queued up after an async operation is complete.

4. Event Loop (Kitchen Supervisor)
The event loop is like the supervisor in the kitchen. Its job is to make sure that once Smit (you) finishes your current task (like cutting vegetables or boiling water), Babu's async task (like bringing ketchup) gets attended to from the callback queue.

In JavaScript, the event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty. If the stack is empty (all synchronous tasks are done), it takes tasks from the callback queue (like fs.readFile completing) and puts them into the call stack to be executed.

In the code, after:
console.log(a);
finishes executing, the event loop checks if there are any asynchronous tasks in the callback queue (like reading the file).
If the file has been read, it processes the promise resolution:
a.then(onDone).catch(onError);
