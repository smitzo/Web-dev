Documentation for Setting Up a MongoDB Database with Compass GUI
1. Create the Database
Log in to MongoDB Atlas:
Go to MongoDB Atlas.

Create a Free Tier Cluster:

Click on Create a Database.
Select the Free Tier (M0) database option.
Choose Cloud Provider and Region:

Select AWS as the cloud provider.
Choose the region Mumbai for hosting your database.
Create the Cluster:

Click Create to initialize your cluster.
2. Setup User Access and IP Whitelist
Navigate to Quick Start:
Once the cluster is created, click on the Quick Start tab.

Create a Database User:

Add a new database user with the following credentials:
Username: admin
Password: Smit2812
Set Up IP Access:

In the IP Address Access List, add the IP range 0.0.0.0/0.
This setting allows your database to be accessed from any location.
Note: Use this cautiously in development environments only, as it allows unrestricted access.
3. View the Created Cluster
Go to the Overview Section.
Locate your newly created database cluster labeled as Cluster0.
4. Connect to the Database
Click on the Connect button in the Cluster0 section.
Choose Compass (GUI to visualize MongoDB databases).
5. Connection String Setup
Copy the Connection String:
The connection string is:

perl
Copy code
mongodb+srv://admin:<db_password>@cluster0.seqfu.mongodb.net/
Replace Placeholder Values:
Update the connection string with the user credentials:

Replace <db_password> with Smit2812.
The final connection string will look like this:

perl
Copy code
mongodb+srv://admin:Smit2812@cluster0.seqfu.mongodb.net/
6. Connect via MongoDB Compass
Open MongoDB Compass on your local machine.
Click on New Connection.
Paste the updated connection string:
perl
Copy code
mongodb+srv://admin:Smit2812@cluster0.seqfu.mongodb.net/
Click Connect to establish a connection to your MongoDB database.
7. Next Steps
You are now connected to your MongoDB instance via MongoDB Compass.
You can explore and manage your database collections, documents, and schemas through the GUI.
